# Extended--TComment

This project is created as course requirement for Course 762 under Prof. Martin Robillard.

@TComment is an existing tool which detects the inconsistencies between Javadoc comments and code. It checks for the null properties of parameters of a method by analyzing the Javadoc comments. 

*Revised Version*

The revised version analyzed the results produced by @TComment and the areas where it failed to capture the null properties of a method. The revised version achieves 14% more accuracy of as compared to the 
original implementation. Also, it is extended to consider the "throws" statement present in a method in order to related a particular exception to the relevant method parameter.
